# Wild-Chicken-Capturing
babo_chickencap is a lightweight and high-performance script that populates areas of your map with wild chickens. Players can track them, bait them with food, and then attempt to capture them. It's the perfect addition for servers that use a chicken coop system or are looking to add immersive and economic activities.
